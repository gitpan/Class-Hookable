Revision history for Perl extension Class::Hookable

0.03  Thu Dec 14:20:00 JST 2007
        * Substantial Changes *
        * Change in the filter method of the plugin *
          Previous Class::Hookable could rewrite a filter only by inheritance,
          but the filter could be changed now every instance by this change.
          The previous filter_register_hook method and filter_run_hook method aren't
          used by this change in default any more.
        * hookable method *
          Hookable method was added.
          There is several difference for hook and method,
          but a detailed thing see POD, please.
          The registered_plugins method was moved to register_callbacks,
          and the function of the delete_plugin method was changed.
        * Addition and change of the utility method *
          The method which operates the hook and the method for
          this addition of the functions was added.
        * Change in the method name *
          I changed the name of several methods to avoid collision with
          the method name when inheriting to Class::Hookable.
          Please see the following list about the method renamed.
        * bug fix *
          It was corrected that a test of the registered_hooks method was failed.
          The cause was that an enumerated hook name isn't being sorted.
          The registered_hooks method starts always to return a sorted result by this correction.
        * The method added newly
          [register method]
          - register_method
          [call method]
          - call_method
          [filter method]
          - hookable_set_filter
          - hookable_call_filter
          - hookable_filter_prefix
          [utility method]
          - registered_methods
          - registered_function
          - delete_method
          - delete_function
          - delete_callback
          [accessor method]
          - hookable_stash
          - hookable_all_methods
        * The method to which the function was changed
          - registered_hooks
            This method had just returned the hook with which a plug-in is registered,
            but it came to return all hook name registered when it was called without arguments.
          - delete_plugin
            This method deleted only the plugin registered with a hook,
            but it came also to delete the hookable method added newly.
        * The method renamed
          [before]                -> [after]
          - context               -> hookable_context
          - hooks                 -> hookable_all_hooks
          - registered_plugins    -> registered_callbacks
        * The abolished method
          - filter_register_hook
          - filter_run_hook
