        * Substantial Changes *
          The change to which it isn't compatible is included in this change.
        * Renamed of several methods
          The method name Class::Hookable uses internally was changed.
          The change is as follows:
            hookable_stash          -> class_hookable_stash
            hookable_context        -> class_hookable_context
            hookable_all_hooks      -> class_hookable_hooks
            hookable_all_method     -> class_hookable_methods
            hookable_set_filter     -> class_hookable_set_filter
            hookable_filter_perfix  -> class_hookable_filter_prefix
            hookable_call_filter    -> class_hookable_filter
        * Change in the specification of the filter
          1. Addition of accessor method which keeps filters
             Accessor method which keeps filters every instance was added.
             The added method is as follows:
            - class_hookable_filters
          2. Change in the behavior of $hook->class_hookable_filter_prefix
             This method was ordinary accessor so far, when prefix of a filter wasn't specified,
             ite came to return value 'class_hookable_filter' of default.
          3. Change in the order of priority search of a filter
             The order of priority search of a filter was changed.
             before:
               1. The filter specified every instance
               2. The filter implemented by a class method
             after:
               1. The filter implemented by a class method
               2. The filter specified every instance
        * Arrangement of API which jumbled up
          The method which jumbled up was arranged and unified.
          This change includes change in the behavior of the method,
          abolition of the method and addition of the new method.
          Added method:
            - remove_hook
            - remove_method
            - clear_hooks
            - clear_methods
          Changed method:
            - registered_hooks
            - registered_methods
          Abolished method:
            - registered_callbacks
            - registered_fuction
            - delete_hook
            - delete_callback
            - delete_method
            - delete_function

        * Substantial Changes *
        * Change in the filter method of the plugin *
          Previous Class::Hookable could rewrite a filter only by inheritance,
          but the filter could be changed now every instance by this change.
          The previous filter_register_hook method and filter_run_hook method aren't
          used by this change in default any more.
        * hookable method *
          Hookable method was added.
          There is several difference for hook and method,
          but a detailed thing see POD, please.
          The registered_plugins method was moved to register_callbacks,
          and the function of the delete_plugin method was changed.
        * Addition and change of the utility method *
          The method which operates the hook and the method for
          this addition of the functions was added.
        * Change in the method name *
          I changed the name of several methods to avoid collision with
          the method name when inheriting to Class::Hookable.
          Please see the following list about the method renamed.
        * bug fix *
          It was corrected that a test of the registered_hooks method was failed.
          The cause was that an enumerated hook name isn't being sorted.
          The registered_hooks method starts always to return a sorted result by this correction.
        * The method added newly
          [register method]
          - register_method
          [call method]
          - call_method
          [filter method]
          - hookable_set_filter
          - hookable_call_filter
          - hookable_filter_prefix
          [utility method]
          - registered_methods
          - registered_function
          - delete_method
          - delete_function
          - delete_callback
          [accessor method]
          - hookable_stash
          - hookable_all_methods
        * The method to which the function was changed
          - registered_hooks
            This method had just returned the hook with which a plug-in is registered,
            but it came to return all hook name registered when it was called without arguments.
          - delete_plugin
            This method deleted only the plugin registered with a hook,
            but it came also to delete the hookable method added newly.
        * The method renamed
          [before]                -> [after]
          - context               -> hookable_context
          - hooks                 -> hookable_all_hooks
          - registered_plugins    -> registered_callbacks
        * The abolished method
          - filter_register_hook
          - filter_run_hook

0.02  Wed Nov 11 13:00:00 JST 2007
        * renamed 2 methods
          filter_plugin     -> filter_register_hook
          dispatch_plugin   -> filter_run_hook
        - classified test files and POD.
        - modified POD.
